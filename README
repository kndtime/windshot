===========================================
Copyright (C) 2016 EPITA.

<h2>Contents</h2>

These is my Android project for 3ie lab of EPITA.

* **Windshot** - an Snapchat like app:

**Note:** This project is meant to work on all Android devices over API 17, The api 16 would have been possible but I have choosen to implement it that way because I've gained some time. I've also compiled the project targeting API 21 (Lollipop) to not have to deal with runtime permission.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

* **Why I haven't implemented the user Birthday
Because it was hard to put in place, I would have to make and use custom date dialog to hold the user imput.
Anthony and Serge told me that wasn't a key feature but clearly nice to have.

* **Why I haven't implemented the phone Location
Because it needed to import libraries, I am not really confortable with using them.

<h2>How to run a problem</h2>

* Just run Android Studio.
* Tap "Open Project" and open "build.gradle" 
* Now you run and test the project

<h3>If you're using Eclipse...</h3>

* Instructions may be updated in the upcoming weeks...

<h2>Support</h2>

* Just hit me up on Github @Kndtime.
* And submit an issue.

<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
