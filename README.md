<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

* **Why I haven't implemented the user Birthday
Because it was hard to put in place, I would have to make and use custom date dialog to hold the user imput.
Anthony and Serge told me that wasn't a key feature but clearly nice to have.

* **Why I haven't implemented the phone Location
Because it needed to import libraries, I am not really confortable with using them.
